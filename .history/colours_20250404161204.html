    <p class ="topic-body">Navi's brand colours each carry a distinct meaning, reinforcing our identity and values. Our primary blue (#506BAE) represents trust, reliability, and professionalism, symbolizing strong and stable connections. The secondary beige (#DBCFBB) adds warmth and approachability, creating a friendly and inviting experience. Moreover, the additional colours provide flexibility for different use cases such as successful message, warnings, and errors. </p>
